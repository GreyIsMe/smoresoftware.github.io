<h1>About the founder</h1>
<h2>"Chrono"</h2>
<p>Hello, I am Chrono head/founder of SmoreSoftware!</p>
<hr>
<p>Chrono, the founder and head of the SmoreSoftware orginazation. He began coding this year and launched SmoreSoftware as part of him learning how to code. He codes primarily in Lua, is begining to become more and more proficient with JavaScript, and also does a little bit of HTML. His introduction to programming was wanting to making custom modifications to the game Minecraft, but after deciding that Java wasn't really his style, he got into Lua, and shortly thereafter, JavaScript. In making Discord Bots, he found a great way to use and strengthen his newfound skills while even having a little fun.</p>
